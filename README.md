# Latin-Risk-Pulse-ML-model

The Latin Risk Pulse is project seeking to better understand Latin American business risks. This repository takes the first step in that process by training a machine learning model to determine whether or not Latin American headlines represent a business risk.

## The data ðŸ›¢
The data was collected by scraping the headlines of online news sources in Latin America. The texts were then put through a keyword matching process before being fed to Google Gemini for labelling. The risk labels include political stability risks, security and violence risks, and economic and regulatory risks.
