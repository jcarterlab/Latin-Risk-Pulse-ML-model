# Latin-Risk-Pulse-ML-model

Latin Risk Pulse is a project seeking to better understand Latin American political, security and economic risks. This repository trains a machine learning model to determine whether or not Latin American headlines (in Spanish & Portuguese) represent a potential risk in any of these domains. To date there are approximately 100 thousand headlines.

## The data üõ¢
The data was collected by scraping the headlines of online news sources in Latin America. The texts were then put through a keyword matching process before being fed to Google Gemini for labelling. The risk labels include political stability risks, security and violence risks, and economic and regulatory risks.

## 01: Data exploration üîç
The data shows a few imbalances, most notably in the risk vs non-risk classes.

## 02: Baseline model üèÅ
A TF-IDF logistic regression baseline model shows extremely low performance on risk headline recall, the main objective of this model. This is likely the result of false negatives in the data.

## 03: Improve labels üè∑Ô∏è
By training a model an half of the data at a time and using it to predict the other half's non-risk headlines, many false negatives can be removed, dramatically improving risk headline recall.
