# Latin-Risk-Pulse-ML-model

Latin Risk Pulse is an organization seeking to better understand Latin American risks. This project trains a machine learning model to help determine whether regional Spanish and Portuguese headlines represent a potential political, security or economic risk. It uses a raw dataset of approximately 100K headlines.

## The data üõ¢
The data was collected by scraping headline text from online news sources in Latin America. The texts were then put through a keyword matching process before being fed to Google Gemini for labelling. The risk labels include 1) political stability, 2) security and violence, and 3) economic and regulatory risks.

## 01: Data exploration üîç
The data shows a few imbalances, most notably in risk vs non-risk headlines.

## 02: Baseline model üöÄ
A TF-IDF logistic regression model shows extremely low performance on risk headline recall, the main objective of this project. This is likely because the keyword matching process missed many risk headlines, resulting in false negatives.

## 03: Improve labels üè∑Ô∏è
Training a model an half of the data at a time and using it to predict the other half's non-risk headlines allows many false negatives to be removed and improves risk headline recall dramatically (albeit at the expense of precision).

## 04: Balance risk types ‚öñÔ∏è
Taking an equal sample from each risk type (political, security and economic) improves overall accuracy, likely because the model is better able to distinguish between previously underrepresented risk types and non-risks.
