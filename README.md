# Latin-Risk-Pulse-ml-model

The Latin Risk Pulse ML model project seeks to create a binary classifier to determine whether Latin American headlines constitute a potential business risk or not. 

## The data ðŸ›¢
The data was collected by scraping the headlines of online news sources in Latin America. The texts were then put through a keyword matching process before being fed to Google Gemnini for labelling. The risk labels include political stability risks, security and violence risks, and economic and regulatory risks.
