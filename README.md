The Latin Risk Pulse ML model seeks to create a binary classifier to determine whether a given headline text constitutes a potential business risk or not. 

## The data ðŸ›¢
The data was collected by scraping the headline text of online news sources in Latin America. The text was then put through a keyword matching process before being fed to Google Gemnini for labelling according to a criteria. The labels include political stability risks, security and violence risks and economic and regulatory risks.
